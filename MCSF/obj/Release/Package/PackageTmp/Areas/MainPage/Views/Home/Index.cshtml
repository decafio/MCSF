        <h2>Michigan Child Support Formula (MCSF)</h2>
        <p>The MCSF is a Statewide Child Support Guideline. The Michigan’s child support guideline (also known as the “formula”) 
        consists of a manual and its most current supplement. Except as otherwise permitted by MCL 552.605, courts must order child 
        support in the amount determined by applying this formula. Unless rebutted by facts in a specific case, the law presumes that 
        this formula (or “guideline”) sets appropriate levels of support.</p>
